version 0.1 developer build - Ludum Dare Release (MiniLd69)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yabac is Team Klaus Klapper's addition to MiniLD69 of Ludum
Dare. You might need love2D (https://love2d.org) in order to
run it, but it should work right out of the box.

For current features, controls, known bugs and more, please
visit our Ludum Dare subscription page where you got this
game from. Future releases will hold more information within
this file.

If you enjoyed this game and are interested in more, please
let us know. There is nothing more motivating to keep up
development of this game as your feedback.

You can also write us at tkk@knanet.de.
